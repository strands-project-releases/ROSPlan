  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/KCL-Planning/ROSPlan into merge-upstream
  * Adding rosplan_rqt to meta package (#4 <https://github.com/LCAS/ROSPlan/issues/4>)
    Not sure if this is supposed to be in there but it is currently missing and hence not install when installing ros-indigo-rosplan. Please, just reject if it should not be installed by default.
  * created "rosplan_config" package to store common information as MongoDB and planner binaries.
  * Revert "changed maintainer to not sending emails to the wrong people"
    This reverts commit a041b5defb4c41ac131b209a72df57ff6358f7fe.
